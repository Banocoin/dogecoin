Dogecoin is a meme coin. A community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme. The Dogecoin Vite Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Dogecoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies now on VITE as DOGE-000!
